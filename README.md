Multi-Agent System
Overview

This repository contains a modular framework for building and experimenting with multi-agent systems (MAS). The project demonstrates how multiple autonomous agents can interact, collaborate, and solve complex tasks in distributed AI environments, as seen in domains such as robotics, game playing, distributed control, and AI research.

Features

•	Customizable agent classes (Coordinator, Worker, Validator, etc.) for specialized roles.

•	Inter-agent communication and protocol support.

•	Distributed task allocation and collaborative decision-making.

•	Modular and extensible codebase for new agent types or environments.

•	Logging and monitoring utilities for agent interactions.

Requirements

•	Python 3.8+ (or newer)

•	NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (for simulation/data analysis)

•	Any additional dependencies as listed in requirements.txt

Install all dependencies with:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Getting Started

1.	Clone the repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/srikruthireddy-pinnapureddy/multi-agent-system.git

2.	Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd multi-agent-system

3.	Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


4.	Run a simulation example or start your own:

bash
python multi_agent_system/main.py

Key Concepts

•	Agents: Autonomous entities capable of decision-making, negotiation, and task execution.

•	Environment: Virtual or simulated context in which agents operate and interact.

•	Interactions: Collaboration, competition, or coordination between agents.

•	Communication: Protocols for information exchange and negotiation.

Example Use Cases

•	Distributed problem-solving and optimization.

•	Multi-robot coordination for navigation or search tasks.

•	AI research in negotiation and consensus-building.
